    abstract = "{The dynamical consequences of a truncation in the disc of a spiral galaxy, like that suggested by the sharp decline of luminosity observed in the outer parts of some edge-on galaxies, are investigated, in relation to the interpretation of observed velocity curves. The disc truncation leaves a ‘signature’ on the rotation curve, in the form of a region of nearly constant velocity, followed by a steep decline of velocity just outside the truncation. Such a feature is clearly present in the observed rotation curve of NGC 5907, in which the luminosity truncation is also present.The observed velocity curve of NGC 5907 can be well reproduced by a two-component model, with a smooth spherical distribution of ‘dark mass’ (a halo) superimposed on the luminous disc. The best-fitting values for the mass in the disc and in the halo (inside the optical truncation) are 9 and 13.5 × 1010 solar masses, respectively. The mass-to-light ratio (luminosity in the J band) is about 11, in solar units.The model predicts the values of some quantities, such as the thickness of the gas layer, that could possibly be observed in the near future, thus providing a clear-cut test of the model itself.}",

	abstract = {We present high-resolution two-dimensional velocity fields from integral field spectroscopy, along with derived rotation curves for 11 low surface brightness galaxies. We fit NFW and pseudoisothermal halo models to the new data combined with previous long-slit and H I data. In most cases, we find the pseudoisothermal halo to better represent the data than the NFW halo, as the NFW concentrations are often lower than expected for a ΛCDM cosmology. We also compare our results to previous studies and find that including the new two-dimensional optical data does not significantly alter the halo parameters but does decrease the uncertainties by roughly a factor of 2.}

	abstract = {We present high-resolution optical velocity fields from DensePak integral field spectroscopy, along with derived rotation curves, for a sample of low surface brightness galaxies. In the limit of no baryons, we fit the NFW and pseudoisothermal halo models to the data and find the rotation curve shapes and halo central densities to be better described by the isothermal halo. For those galaxies with photometry, we present halo fits for three assumptions of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, Υ*. We find that the velocity contribution from the baryons is significant enough in the maximum disk case that maximum disk and the NFW halo are mutually exclusive. We find a substantial cusp mass excess at the centers of the galaxies, with at least 2 times more mass expected in the cuspy CDM halo than is allowed by the data. We also find that to reconcile the data with ΛCDM, ~20 km s−1 noncircular motions are needed and/or the power spectrum has a lower amplitude on the scales that we probe.}

    abstract = "{We present the Fabry–Perot observations obtained for a new set of 108 galaxies in the frame of the Gassendi Hα survey of SPirals (GHASP). The GHASP survey consists of 3D Hα data cubes for 203 spiral and irregular galaxies, covering a large range in morphological types and absolute magnitudes, for kinematics analysis. The new set of data presented here completes the survey. The GHASP sample is by now the largest sample of Fabry–Perot data ever published. The analysis of the whole GHASP sample will be done in forthcoming papers. Using adaptive binning techniques based on Voronoi tessellations, we have derived Hα data cubes from which are computed Hα maps, radial velocity fields as well as residual velocity fields, position–velocity diagrams, rotation curves and the kinematical parameters for almost all galaxies. Original improvements in the determination of the kinematical parameters, rotation curves and their uncertainties have been implemented in the reduction procedure. This new method is based on the whole 2D velocity field and on the power spectrum of the residual velocity field rather than the classical method using successive crowns in the velocity field. Among the results, we point out that morphological position angles have systematically higher uncertainties than kinematical ones, especially for galaxies with low inclination. The morphological inclination of galaxies having no robust determination of their morphological position angle cannot be constrained correctly. Galaxies with high inclination show a better agreement between their kinematical inclination and their morphological inclination computed assuming a thin disc. The consistency of the velocity amplitude of our rotation curves has been checked using the Tully–Fisher relationship. Our data are in good agreement with previous determinations found in the literature. Nevertheless, galaxies with low inclination have statistically higher velocities than expected and fast rotators are less luminous than expected.}",

    abstract = "{We study a large set of high spatial resolution optical rotation curves of galaxies with the goal of determining the model parameters for a disc embedded within a cold dark matter (CDM) halo, which we model with either a Navarro—Frenk—White (NFW) profile or pseudo-isothermal profile. We show that parameter degeneracies present in lower resolution data are lifted at these higher resolutions. 34 per cent of the galaxies do not have a meaningful fit when using the NFW profile and 32 per cent when using the pseudo-isothermal profile, however only 14 per cent do not have a meaningful fit in either model. In both models we find correlations between the disc baryon fraction fd and the spin parameter of the halo λ′, between fd and the dark halo mass M200, and between M200 and the concentration parameter c. We show that the distribution of the concentration parameter c, for a NFW halo, is in good agreement with CDM predictions; no significant galaxy population is found with very low values of c. The overall distribution of λ′ is in good agreement with theoretical predictions from hierarchical tidal torque theory. The whole sample is also well fitted by a pseudo-isothermal dark halo with a core, but the size of the core is rather small (6 per cent of the virial radius or smaller; for 70 per cent of the sample the core size is less than 2 kpc). Thus we conclude that the profile of dark matter is steep (r−1 or steeper) down to this radius; large dark matter cores (and therefore very low dark matter central densities) seem to be excluded. Low-surface-brightness galaxies tend to have higher values of λ′ for a given fd and lower values of c for a given mass than high-surface-brightness galaxies. In an appendix we give some useful formulae for pseudo-isothermal profile haloes and we discuss in detail the issue of parameter degeneracies.}",

I show the rotation curves for a family of fiducial bulges with Sérsic surface brightness profiles and with various concentrations and intrinsic axis ratios. Both parameters have a profound impact on the shape of the rotation curve. In particular, I show how the peak rotation velocity, as well as the radius where it is reached, depends on both parameters.I also discuss the implications of the flattening of a bulge for the decomposition of a rotation curve and use the case of NGC 5533 to show the errors that result from neglecting it. For NGC 5533, neglecting the flattening of the bulge leads to an overestimate of its mass-to-light ratio by approximately 30 per cent and an underestimate of the contributions from the stellar disc and dark matter halo in the regions outside the bulge-dominated area.}",

We use new neutral hydrogen (H i) observations from the Very Large Array to examine the neutral gas morphology and kinematics. We find an H i disc with a well-behaved flat rotation curve in the radial range 20–140 arcsec. Ionized gas observations from the SparsePak integral field unit on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope provide kinematics for the central 70 arcsec. We use both the SparsePak and H i velocity fields to derive a rotation curve for NGC 5005. Deep 3.6 μm observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope probe the faint extended stellar population of NGC 5005. The images reveal a large stellar disc with a high surface brightness component that transitions to a low surface brightness component at a radius nearly 1.6 times farther than the extent of the gas disc detected in H i. The 3.6 μm image is also decomposed into bulge and disc components to account for the stellar light distribution. Optical broad-band B and R and narrowband Hα from the WIYN 0.9 m telescope complement the 3.6 μm data by providing information about the dominant stellar population and current star formation activity. The neutral and ionized gas rotation curve is used along with the stellar bulge and disc light profiles to decompose the mass distributions in NGC 5005 and determine a dark matter halo model. The maximum stellar disc contribution to the total rotation curve is only about 70 per cent, suggesting that dark matter makes a significant contribution to the dynamics at all radii.}",
